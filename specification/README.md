# Definition

The **rediops devops.json** file has been defined using OpenAPI but that does not imply that
a real API needs to be deployed or used.  On the contrary it is unlikely that the main
copy stored on Git is accessed via a API service.  The **devops.json** file can also
include a AsyncOpen definition, so the one definition **devops.json** definition
can support a single compute resource that handles both synchronous and asynchronous
service models for a subject domain.

You could build a catalogue service of all your **devops.json** definitions linked to
Git definitions, but that is not a specification requirement.

The OpenAPI definition can be viewed in
