This is the location for documentation associated with
suggested the **rediops** process.  The objective is to increase
the velocity of feature development by using tools to reduce
the repetitious tasks or at least reduce the number of keystrokes.

The documents should be read in the following sequence:

* [setup](setup.md) Once of desktop setup
* [project start](project_start.md) Starting a new project or initiative
* [analysis start](analysis_start.md) Focus on technical API analysis
* [developer server_start](developer_server_start.md) Initial server coding
* [developer client_start](developer_client_start.md) Initial client coding
* [developer update](developer_update.md) API updates during the development lifecycle

The process above is in the context of exposing functionality defined in 
API service that can be consumed by clients - commonly a web or app user
interface.

**All flows are high level process depictions and can
be adjusted to suit your tools**
