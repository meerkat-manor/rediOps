# Setup desktop (start)

This is the setup desktop tasks that is performed by 
the developers, though others that are updating code
including documentation can also perform the setup. 

This task is expected to be done only once for a desktop
environment, and the environment can be used for 
multiple projects and deliveries.

## Software installation

Please ensure the following tools or equivalents are
installed or you have access to servers with the
associated capabilities.

* A Git repository server - Github, Gitea
* Rights to create a Git repo and push content to the remote Git repo
* Integrated development environment (IDE) software - Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ
* Access to an OpenAPI editor - ApiCurio, Swagger UI
* Installed **qaskx-cli** tool
* Access to a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) - ServiceNow, Zenoss
* Access to an API registry portal - Apiman.io, Redocly



# End Status of flow

At the end of the above setup steps the desktop will have the base tools
that are mentioned in subsequent documents. 

The next step in the process is covered in [project_start](project_start.md)

# Reading Notes

The suggested tools are only that, suggestions.  You can substitute 
your own preferred tools as appropriate.  The concept is still valid
and your mileage may vary.
